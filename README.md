# virtual-assistant-using-python
I've developed a Python virtual assistant activated by saying 'Hey Computer'. You can ask it about any popular person, and it will provide a 3-4 sentence summary about them. It also answers questions about the current time and date, offering real-time information. This assistant is a handy tool for quick facts and basic time management.
